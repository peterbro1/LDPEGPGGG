Logarithmically Depreciating Probability with Exponential Payout Growth Gambling Game

Adds a crash gambling system to Minecraft similar to online casinos. Requires vault to run. Code uses a provably fair algorithm with configurable "house edge"

I do not write Minecraft plugins anymore, but the code for this was requested. Use it as you see fit.

Edit 2022:

#### There is no documentation or support as this was a privately contracted project never meant to be shared publicly. This is now abandoned, and I do not plan to maintain it.
